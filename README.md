# Numerical examples to compare the confidence level corresponding to the observed Fisher Information and the expected Fisher Information
This repository includes numerical examples of the comparison of observed Fisher Information and expected Fisher Information in interval estimation. The first example is the Mixture Gaussian distribution, and the second example is the signal-plus-noise example, and the third example is the state-space model. In the Mixture Gaussian example, we include different sample size and different real values of the parameter. In the signal-plus-noise example, we consider 1-d and 4-d case. In the state-space model, we consider different sample sizes. As a result, when we compare confidence levels, the confidence level corresponding to the expected FIM always performs better than the confidence level corresponding to the observed FIM, in an MSE sense.
